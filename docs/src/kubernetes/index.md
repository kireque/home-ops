# Kubernetes

My main cluster is [Talos](http://talos.dev/) provisioned on bare-metal using the official `talosctl` CLI tool. I render my [Talos configuration](https://github.com/kireque/home-ops/tree/main/infrastructure/talos/cluster-0) using the [talhelper](https://github.com/budimanjojo/talhelper) CLI tool. This allows me to keep the Talos configuration as DRY as possible.

This is a semi hyper-converged cluster, workloads and block storage are sharing the same available resources on my nodes while I have a separate server for (NFS) file storage.
